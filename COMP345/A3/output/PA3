q1.txt
Topic:
	What countries are or have been involved in land or water boundarydisputes with each other over oil resources or exploration? How havedisputes been resolved, or towards what kind of resolution are thecountries moving? What other factors affect the disputes?

in file: q1docs/1, searching: THERE IS no mistaking the anxiety aroused in south-east Asia by China's recent and loud reiteration of its claim to the South China Sea, a claim underlined by the granting of an oil exploration concession in May to a little-known American company in a disputed area near the Spratly islands.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Notwithstanding China's statements to the contrary, the governments of the region believe that Beijing is taking advantage of a post-Cold War power vacuum - left by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of US forces from bases in the Philippines - to assert some authority over its weaker neighbours.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: The foreign ministers of Asean (the Association of South East Asian Nations, comprising Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand) confronted the Spratlys dispute head-on at their annual meeting, held in Manila in July.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: They put their concerns directly to their Chinese counterpart Mr Qian Qichen, and appealled for a peaceful settlement of the various disputes.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: The claimants to the islets, reefs and atolls of the Spratlys include China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia - and all except Brunei have troops in the archipelago.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Scuba-diving expeditions for tourists to one of the Malaysian-held islands are regarded as another useful way of asserting sovereignty.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Mr Abdullah Badawi, the Malaysian foreign minister, told the Asean meeting that his government wanted to sustain Asean's record as the world's fastest growing economic region, and therefore viewed 'with grave concern' the revival of the Spratlys issue.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: 'Any adverse development leading to heightened tension or conflict could only result in dire consequences to the region's well-being,' he said, 'bringing in its wake the risk of extra-regional involvement and putting back years of painstaking efforts at nurturing relations based on mutual trust and confidence.'
in file: q1docs/1, searching: The end of the Cold War, in other words, has created something of a foreign policy dilemma for Malaysia, whose government regards itself as a champion of the developing world and the non-aligned movement.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: The disintegration of the Soviet Union threatens to give the United States an unacceptably dominant role in world affairs, but too great a reduction of the US presence in Asia could leave the way clear for equally unacceptable moves by regional powers such as China, India and Japan.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Malaysia's response has been to continue condemning the west in public, while maintaining good relations with the western powers in practice and strengthening and rearming its own military forces.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Western diplomats say hopefully that they detect a lessening of Malaysian rhetorical support for Zopfan - the south-east Asian, anti-superpower concept which stands for Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Aside from arms purchases, Malaysia's ties with the west include the five-power defence agreement (linking Malaysia, Singapore, Britain, Australia and New Zealand), a commercial deal to repair US Navy ships at Lumut on the west coast of the peninsula, and a US-Malaysian joint venture called Airod at Kuala Lumpur's Subang airport to maintain C-130 transport aircraft.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Malaysian officials and Kuala Lumpur-based diplomats agree that Malaysia's abrasive foreign policy is very much the creation of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: They attribute his combative speeches - whether he is rejecting criticism of Malaysia's logging industry or accusing the west of imperialism - partly to personal conviction and partly to his ambitions as a leader of the third world.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: 'He felt Malaysia would get more attention if it became more awkward,' said one senior diplomat.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: 'His desire is partly to make sure that Malaysia is not taken for granted, but also to put Malaysia on the map in a leadership role for the third world.'
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Dr Mahathir is said by his advisers to receive letters of support from other third world leaders, who agree with what he says but do not dare to say it themselves, although his confrontational style is not always appreciated.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: At home, some officials have sought to prevent him from antagonising the country's allies, and at the Earth Summit in Brazil in June he received less support than he would have liked for his adversarial approach to the industrialised nations.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: He also angered some of his fellow Asean leaders by announcing a proposal to set up an East Asian Economic Caucus - a controversial trade group excluding the US - without sufficient prior consultations.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: An increasingly important influence on Malaysian foreign policy is the country's domestic Islamic constituency, which has some sympathy for the newly-devout President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, for the Moslem inhabitants of Bosnia and for all things Moslem.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Dr Mahathir often accuses the west of double standards - he recently commented that western countries were willing to interfere in defence of human rights in Malaysia but not in Israel or Bosnia - but his critics make the same accusation in reverse about Malaysia.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: It was noticeable that Malaysia took little interest in the persecution of the predominantly Buddhist Burmese people by the authorities in Rangoon until Burmese Moslems started fleeing into Bangladesh.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: 'Mahathir runs foreign policy, and some of what he does is aimed at protecting his Islamic flank,' says another diplomat.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Perhaps the most commonly heard criticism of Malaysian policy is that it is old-fashioned, rooted in the 1960s and based on the questionable assumption that the world is divided into two rival factions - the rich industrialised north, and the poor exploited south.
in file: q1docs/1, searching: Such a world vision is difficult to reconcile with the reality of Asia: while Dr Mahathir was forging a third world consensus on the environment at a pre-Earth Summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur in April, companies and governments from north and south were happily selling weapons to each other at a defence exhibition a couple of kilometres away across town; in the South China Sea, Beijing - a leader of the south - is flexing its muscles to the detriment of its fellow southerners; and Malaysia, a champion of the south, is developing so successfully along capitalist lines that it is well on the way to becoming a fully paid-up member of the north.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: THE conflicting territorial claims to the Spratly islands have been vividly illustrated in photographs and television pictures released by the various claimants.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: The most recent, from Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, takes on an almost comical air.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: It shows three men on a tiny rock in the middle of the South China Sea with a Chinese flag, a concrete territorial marker and a hut - twice as big as the rock itself - standing on stilts in the shallows.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: Nothing could illustrate more clearly the nature of argument over the 100 or more atolls, reefs and islets that make up the Spratly islands: few people would want or be able to live there unsupported, but governments want to own them to lay claim to the surrounding waters.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: The islands - called the Nansha by China and the Kalayaan by the Philippines  -are scattered along the shipping route between the Indian Ocean and north-east Asia, and are believed to have oil and gas deposits under the seabed.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: The main protagonists in the dispute are China and Vietnam, but Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei also lay claim to all or some of the Spratlys.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: With the exception of the small sultanate of Brunei, all have troops stationed in the archipelago.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: At a south-east Asian summit six months ago, nobody gave much thought to a dispute which has simmered since the second world war and only occasionally erupted into violence.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: In February, however, China passed a law reaffirming its sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and reserving the right to use military force to defend its claims.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: Vietnam protested.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: So did Japan, because the Chinese law also embraced a group of islands claimed by Tokyo in the East China Sea.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: In May, as if to underline the message that the South China Sea was not called the South China Sea for nothing, the Chinese authorities signed an agreement with Crestone Energy Corp of Denver to explore for oil between Vietnam and Malaysia.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: The concession area is regarded by Vietnam as part of its continental shelf and lies about 1,000km south of the Chinese island of Hainan.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: Vietnam, which says it lost 72 men and three vessels in a battle with China over the Spratlys in 1988, protested again.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: Japan and the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - have watched China's forays into the Spratlys with growing alarm.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: At a meeting of foreign ministers in Manila last week, Malaysia said it was watching events with 'grave concern'; the Philippines said a solution should be urgently sought to avoid 'perilous developments'; and Indonesia spoke of the danger of 'mutually destructive confrontation'.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: Although only the Filipinos were openly prepared to admit it, there was considerable debate over the risk of Chinese expansionism and the desirability of continued US and Russian military deployment in the region to provide a 'balance of forces'.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister who was a guest at the meeting, denied that China was seeking regional hegemony.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: China, he said, wanted to shelve disputes and proceed with 'joint development' of the Spratlys.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: However, Asean ministers were apparently unable to elicit an explanation as to how China reconciled its 1991 rapprochement with Vietnam and its talk of 'joint development' with the planting of new territorial markers on the atolls and the unilateral decision to award an exploration contract to Crestone.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: The region's optimists say it was inevitable that irritating disputes like the Spratlys would surface once the cold war ended.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: They believe that China, preoccupied with domestic politics and the strains of economic growth, is testing the mettle of its neighbours with its recent activities in the South China Sea.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, told the Asean meeting how much the region had progressed since he first came to Manila as a young diplomat in the 1950s.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: The pessimists, despite claims by the US and Russia that each intends to remain a Pacific power, view the end of the cold war and the closure of US bases in the Philippines with foreboding.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: They see China as a potential regional bully whose influence is already visible in Beijing's support for the Burmese junta and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: 'The Chinese will have the option to use 'gunboat diplomacy' as a means to achieving their political objectives,' wrote Tai Ming Cheung in a paper on the growth of Chinese naval power for the Institute of South East Asian Studies.
in file: q1docs/2, searching: 'As the navy grows stronger, the chances of conflict over the Spratlys becomes an increasingly real possibility, unless a satisfactory diplomatic solution can be found in the next few years.'
in file: q1docs/2, searching: The paper was published in 1990.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: NOTHING in the bustling commercial scene at the main border post between China and Vietnam contradicts the idea of a warm relationship suggested by the name Friendship Gate.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Under a drizzling sky, cheerful traders carry boxes of Chinese apples, sewing machines and rice bowls from Chinese to Vietnamese lorries parked back-to-back in a sea of mud.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: A raucous, red-faced Chinese woman smuggling playing cards into Vietnam supervises her workers as they pile empty lightbulb cartons into a truck to hide the real merchandise.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: For the region's desperately poor inhabitants, the trade is a welcome spinoff of the 1991 'normalisation' of relations between Beijing and Hanoi - 12 years earlier the Chinese army invaded and laid waste this part of northern Vietnam to avenge the invasion of Cambodia and the overthrow of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: But the busy scenes at the border belie the reality of the Sino-Vietnamese relationship.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: In spite of frequent exchanges of high-level dignitaries and the signing of several bilateral agreements, the two countries continue to regard each other with suspicion and, sometimes, outright hostility.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Since last year China has not only dragged its feet in implementing trade agreements and attempted to extend its control across the frontier, but has made forays into the southern reaches of the South China Sea close to the Vietnamese coast.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: This has threatened development of Vietnam's vital oil industry and triggered alarm in other south-east Asian countries, such as Malaysia, about the future of the disputed Spratly islands.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Beijing granted last year an offshore oil exploration concession to Crestone, a US company, in an area Vietnam says is on its continental shelf.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Vietnam says China has also seized more than 20 cargo vessels plying the route between Hong Kong and northern Vietnam.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: The ships have been released but the Chinese, accusing the Vietnamese shippers of smuggling goods to China, have confiscated some cargo without compensation.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: 'China sees this as a good opportunity to fill the power vacuum left by the reduction of US forces in the region and the strategic retreat from the region made by Russia,' says Mr Nguyen Ngoc Dien of the Hanoi Foreign Ministry's Institute of International Relations.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Vietnam treats Chinese denials with scepticism.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: 'In their declarations they are anti-hegemonist but in practice they are hegemonist in putting pressure on the smaller countries around them,' says Maj-Gen Tran Cong Man, a government spokesman.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Even the booming border trade between the two countries is a source of friction.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Vietnam says China is reluctant to promote official commerce - it has refused to re-open the railway near Friendship Gate - and is instead encouraging smuggling of Chinese consumer goods, a trade which undermines Vietnamese factories.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: 'With smuggling,' says Mrs Pham Chi Lan, of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 'we are spending a lot of hard currency needed for the import of capital goods on buying products that can be produced in Vietnam.'
in file: q1docs/3, searching: The Vietnamese, who have fought against Chinese domination for the last 2,000 years, are feeling particularly nervous about China's military and economic might at the moment.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: The peace agreement in neighbouring Cambodia appears to be falling apart, leaving the way clear for Khmer Rouge guerrillas, Beijing's former proteges, to kill Vietnamese settlers and cause trouble on the border.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: The trouble for Hanoi is that there is not much it can do without provoking China or undermining its fragile economic recovery.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Ethnic Chinese businessmen still dominate the Vietnamese economy, and a large share of foreign investment is of Chinese ethnic origin, coming from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Vietnam's army has been halved in size to some 600,000 men, and the navy is too small to protect Vietnamese interests in the South China Sea.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: The Soviet Union, Vietnam's long-time ally, has disintegrated.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: Hence Vietnam's desperate attempts to make friends with the US - which maintains an economic and diplomatic embargo on Hanoi dating back to the Vietnam war - and to strengthen ties with the European Community.
in file: q1docs/3, searching: As one diplomat in Hanoi put it: 'Vietnam is in the unfortunate position of having lost one superpower and being unlikely to get an alliance with the one remaining.'
in file: q1docs/4, searching: The Vietnamese are enjoying themselves.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: After half a century of warfare and dour communist rule, the country's 70m inhabitants - urban and rural - have responded enthusiastically to the free market policies progressively introduced by the government over the past seven years.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: With an average per capita gross domestic product of Dollars 220 a year, Vietnam is still one of the world's poorest countries, but the traits of a modern consumer society are emerging everywhere from the trading towns on the Chinese border in the north to the beach resort of Vung Tau in the south.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: In the once sleepy capital Hanoi, foreigners and Vietnamese are building hotels, office blocks and private houses, replicating the construction and business boom which is already well under way in Ho Chi Minh City, the southern commercial centre previously known as Saigon.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: The public tennis courts in the central port city of Danang are packed with eager if inexpert players; in nearby Hue, students are contentedly drinking beer in bars which opened only months ago.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: In Ho Chi Minh City, a new supermarket was forced to close its doors after only four days because it could not meet the demands of its customers: the check-out queues were one and a half hours long.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: There is, as Vietnamese officials admit, an ugly side to Vietnam's transformation.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Corruption, greed and prostitution have flourished in the liberal economic climate.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: But the incipient urban prosperity that allows the wealthier Vietnamese to buy new motorcycles and build new homes is underpinned by solid and nationwide economic achievements since the communist government launched its policy of doi moi (renovation).
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Ruthless restriction of the money supply has forced inflation down from more than 700 per cent in 1986 to less than 10 per cent today.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Foreign investors have proposed Dollars 6.8bn of projects in the five years since the first foreign investment law was enacted.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Exports - including rice, textiles and seafood - have been growing at an average 30 per cent a year in the same period.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: The economy grew by 8.3 per cent last year, a performance which will almost be matched in 1993.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Vietnam reacted nimbly to the collapse of communism in eastern Europe, shifting the focus of its trade away from the former Soviet bloc countries to new partners in Asia and the west.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: According to the trade ministry, all of Vietnam's light industrial exports went to the east bloc in 1988.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Last year the figure was 4 per cent.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Most remarkable of all, the first stage of Vietnam's shift from central planning to the export-oriented industrialisation policies that have been so successful elsewhere in Asia was achieved with hardly any assistance from foreign donors.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: It was only in July that the US withdrew its objections to multilateral aid for Vietnam from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: The US bilateral economic embargo dating back to the communist Vietnam War victory in 1975 remains in force, but the boycott is now at least as frustrating for American companies as it is for Vietnam.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: So much foreign aid money will flood into the country - Vietnam was promised Dollars 1.86bn at its first donors' conference in Paris this month - that the management skills of the government's Soviet-educated ministers and bureaucrats will be severely tested.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: The government has set a target of doubling Vietnam's GDP in the current decade, and it estimates that success will require a total investment of about Dollars 40bn - of which half is supposed to come from domestic sources and the remainder from foreign direct investment and foreign aid.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, readily acknowledges the enormity of the task that lies ahead.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: In an introduction to the Vietnamese document prepared for the donor conference, he lamented the decline of social services and the severity of unemployment.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: He also emphasised the importance of repairing the country's battered infrastructure and spoke of the need to strengthen the legal system in order to allow the market economy to work properly.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: 'There is still much for us to do and there remain many difficulties to overcome in order to carry on with our renovation programme and to realise our socio-economic goals,' he wrote.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Mr Kiet and his reformist allies are operating in a difficult political environment.
in file: q1docs/4, searching: Advocates of reform say social services were already declining under the bankrupt policies of the past and that the switch to a market economy - bringing with it the benefits of foreign aid and investment - was made only just in time.

in file: q1docs/6, searching: But the latter would be formally led by the country occupying the presidency, which since January 1 is Greece.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: In this case Greece was not only unrepresented, but its absence was virtually the object of the exercise.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: For different reasons both the UK and Germany see themselves as Turkey's main friends and advocates within the EU; and even though British officials insist no discourtesy to Greece is intended, both governments are anxious to reassure the Turks that the six-month Greek presidency will not damage EU-Turkish relations.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: The Turks are delighted by the gesture, while Greece has denounced it as a breach of the EU common foreign and security policy, supposedly in operation since the Maastricht treaty came into force last November 1.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: The meeting provides a potent reminder of the importance west European countries attach to their relationship with Turkey - 'not a luxury but a necessity', Mr Hurd said on Wednesday - and of their impatience with Greek efforts to block that relationship in the hope of extorting Turkish concessions on Cyprus.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: Greek-Turkish relations, seldom warm even before Turkey occupied two-fifths of Cyprus and drove out the Greek-speaking population in 1974, have been almost continuously tense since then.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: Their bilateral relations are also envenomed by a long-running dispute about oil-exploration rights on the continental shelf under the Aegean Sea - an issue which came close to causing war in 1989, and which Greece now threatens to revive.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: But in western Europe Turkey is increasingly seen as the political and commercial hub of the eastern Mediterranean, as well as a potentially stabilising influence in the Turkic-speaking republics of the former Soviet Union.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: In Europe as in the US, Turkey is viewed as a regional power, a secular democratic role model, and a buffer to Islamic expansion in the Middle East.

in file: q1docs/6, searching: This month, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, visited Athens and appealed to Greece to adopt a 'realistic and strategic view of Turkey's importance'.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: Turkey is already smarting at the way its application for EU membership has been politely shelved since 1989 - while Efta countries, and perhaps even former communist satellites in central and eastern Europe, are allowed to jump the queue.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: The latter prospect, clearly flagged by last year's Copenhagen summit, is especially galling to the Turks who feel their record as solid Nato allies since the mid 1950s, and their support for the west in the Gulf war, entitle them to expect better treatment.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: Many of the reservations about Turkey's qualifications for EU membership expressed by the Commission in 1989 still stand: the problems presented by Turkey's large population; its heavy dependence on agriculture for employment; and perhaps most emphatically, its less than creditable human rights record.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: A recent debate in the British House of Lords, strongly critical of Turkish policy towards its Kurdish minority, was a salutary reminder for Turkish officials of the difficulty the country faces in improving its image in the west.

in file: q1docs/6, searching: At the same time the Turks are eagerly seeking clarification of the offer of associate membership of the Western European Union - the EU's defence arm and 'European pillar' of Nato - made to them last year, which they have yet to put to their parliament for ratification.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: During his visit, Mr Hurd tried to define a comprehensive agenda, aimed at transforming the EU Turkish relationship: completion of the customs union on time, a more intensive political dialogue on issues covered by the EU's common foreign and security policy, and a deepening of the defence relationship - while at the same time Turkey has to push ahead with legal and human rights reforms at home.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: The UK is also urging Turkey to make renewed efforts to reach an early solution of the Cyprus problem, stressing that this has been an obstacle to improved relations, not just with Greece, but with Europe as a whole and indeed the US.
in file: q1docs/6, searching: It will not be easy, since the Turkish Cypriot leader Mr Rauf Denktas is attached to his independent status, while the Greek Cypriot president, Mr Glafkos Clerides, elected last year, is on the whole less flexible than his predecessor.

in file: q1docs/6, searching: 'The issue is whether the Union has the will to overcome the veto of just one of its members.'
in file: q1docs/6, searching: Mr Hurd's and Mr Kinkel's visit may have partly reassured him but, coming in a week when the Turkish lira collapsed as several key economic indicators diverged further from the European norm, it should also have served to demonstrate that Turkey's problems with the EU are by no means all of Greek origin.

in file: q1docs/7, searching: They also want officials of the member countries to meet more than once a year.
in file: q1docs/7, searching: China, on the other hand, favours a slower start for ARF, apparently because it does not want to become enmeshed in multilateral negotiations over territorial disputes when it has so much clout in bilateral meetings.
in file: q1docs/7, searching: Several ideas for enhancing regional security have already been aired ahead of today's inaugural meeting.

	'Any adverse development leading to heightened tension or conflict could only result in dire consequences to the region's well-being,' he said, 'bringing in its wake the risk of extra-regional involvement and putting back years of painstaking efforts at nurturing relations based on mutual trust and confidence.' They attribute his combative speeches - whether he is rejecting criticism of Malaysia's logging industry or accusing the west of imperialism - partly to personal conviction and partly to his ambitions as a leader of the third world. Dr Mahathir is said by his advisers to receive letters of support from other third world leaders, who agree with what he says but do not dare to say it themselves, although his confrontational style is not always appreciated. Dr Mahathir often accuses the west of double standards - he recently commented that western countries were willing to interfere in defence of human rights in Malaysia but not in Israel or Bosnia - but his critics make the same accusation in reverse about Malaysia. 'Mahathir runs foreign policy, and some of what he does is aimed at protecting his Islamic flank,' says another diplomat. At issue is the ownership of the Spratly Islands and their surrounding seas which are claimed, in whole or part, by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Nothing could illustrate more clearly the nature of argument over the 100 or more atolls, reefs and islets that make up the Spratly islands: few people would want or be able to live there unsupported, but governments want to own them to lay claim to the surrounding waters. The main protagonists in the dispute are China and Vietnam, but Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei also lay claim to all or some of the Spratlys. The trouble for Hanoi is that there is not much it can do without provoking China or undermining its fragile economic recovery. The inevitability of reform, however, has not prevented many Vietnamese from resenting the rampant corruption that has accompanied economic growth or from complaining that the good aspects of communism - free education for example - have been thrown out with the bad. 'Some people talk about the dragon,' says Do Duc Dinh, a Vietnamese economist, 'but I think it may take three or four decades to come to that, and it depends on our efforts.' It would be normal for either to visit Turkey alone or, in special circumstances, for both to participate in a European Union mission. The report says tension in the Aegean has also been stoked by supplies to both countries of new and secondhand ships from other Nato countries.

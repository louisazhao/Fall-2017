Ghost In The Noonday Sun
Topic:
	Bumbling pirate crewman  kills his captain after learning where he has hidden buried treasure. However as he begins to lose his memory, he relies more and more on the ghost of the man he's murdered to help him find the treasure. This film provided a reunion of sorts for Sellers with his onetime Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan, who appears halfway through the film.

	Confessions from a Holiday Camp	1977	2259783	Timmy Lea and his brother-in-law Sidney Noggett are working as entertainment officers at Funfrall, a typical British holiday camp. The staff are lazy and inefficient, preferring to laze by the pool rather than organise activities for the holiday campers. A new owner, Mr. Whitemonk, an ex-prison officer, takes over the camp and is determined to install discipline into the staff. He is on the verge of dismissing Timmy and Sidney; however, Sidney's suggestion of organising a beauty contest changes his mind. Producer Michael Klinger wasn't happy with the script, noting a number of problems that he felt detracted from the quality that set the series apart from its imitators.http://michaelklingerpapers.uwe.ac.uk/docs1/holiday%20camp2.pdf
